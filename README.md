I had to re-do all of his work, though, as the M6 I have is ISO, and Japanese (92 key vs 87)

TODO
Use Teensy2++ to make QMK firmware work as is
Investigate strain gauge circuit to make nipple mouse work
Investigate IO expander to reduce pin count from 29+6 to 6+6
Pick new microcontroller
3D Print Case to hold PCB, ribbons, and board itself.
